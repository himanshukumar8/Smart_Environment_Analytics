# 📘 Smart Environment Analytics  

### 🌍 Overview  
EnviroCluster is a **data science project** that applies **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **K-Means clustering** to analyze **air and water quality datasets**. The goal is to reduce dimensionality, identify hidden patterns, and group regions based on environmental conditions — enabling **actionable insights for monitoring pollution levels**.  

---

### ⚙️ Features  
- ✅ Dimensionality reduction with **PCA** for efficient feature extraction  
- ✅ Unsupervised learning with **K-Means** clustering  
- ✅ Visualization of clusters using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
- ✅ Insights for environmental monitoring and policy-making

### 📂 Project Structure  
```bash
EnviroCluster/
│── data/               # Raw datasets (air & water quality)  
│── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis  
│── src/                # Python scripts for preprocessing, PCA, clustering  
│── results/            # Cluster plots, visualizations, and reports  
│── README.md           # Project documentation  
│── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies  
```

### 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy, Pandas** → Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- **Scikit-learn** → PCA, K-Means clustering  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Development & experimentation  

---

### 📊 Results  
- PCA reduced dataset dimensionality by capturing **most variance with fewer features**.  
- K-Means successfully clustered regions into **distinct pollution categories**.  
- Visualizations revealed patterns in **air & water quality indicators** across regions.

### 🚀 Getting Started  

#### 1️⃣ Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/himanshukumar8/Smart_Environment_Analytics.git
cd EnviroCluster
```

#### 2️⃣ Install dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3️⃣ Run the analysis  
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/EnviroCluster.ipynb
```

### 📌 Future Improvements  
- Experiment with **other clustering methods** (DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering).  
- Incorporate **time-series analysis** of pollution data.  
- Deploy results as an **interactive dashboard** (e.g., Streamlit, Dash).
